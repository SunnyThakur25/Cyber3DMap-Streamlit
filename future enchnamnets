Future Enhancements for Cyber3DMap-Streamlit

    Device-Specific Icons in 3D Map:
        Detail: Replace generic node dots with GNS3-like icons (e.g., router, server, PC) based on Nmap OS detection or service type (e.g., SMB → Windows server).
        Benefit: Enhances visual realism for pentesters, making node roles intuitive.
        Implementation: Use Plotly’s scatter3d with custom SVG markers in visualizer.py. Parse Nmap <osmatch> tags in parser.py.
        Source Inspiration: Advanced 3D visualization with custom markers in Streamlit.

Packet Flow Animation:

    Detail: Animate packet movement along edges to simulate network traffic or attack paths (e.g., purple node to red node).
    Benefit: Visualizes lateral movement for red team planning.
    Implementation: Add Plotly animation frames in visualizer.py, triggered by threat simulation in app.py.
    Source Inspiration: Streamlit’s support for dynamic 3D visualizations like CesiumJS.

Live Nmap Scanning Integration:

    Detail: Add a UI button to run Nmap scans directly (e.g., nmap -sV -oX scan.xml 192.168.1.1-10) and auto-upload XML.
    Benefit: Streamlines real-time pentesting, reducing manual steps.
    Implementation: Use subprocess in app.py with input fields for IP range and options. Limit to 10 hosts.
    Security: Sanitize inputs to prevent command injection.

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:

    Detail: Map CVEs to MITRE ATT&CK techniques (e.g., CVE-2020-0796 → T1210) and display in node hover data.
    Benefit: Aligns with pentester frameworks for tactical planning.
    Implementation: Integrate MITRE ATT&CK API in cve_fetcher.py. Update visualizer.py for hover display.
    Source Inspiration: Stellar Cyber’s MITRE ATT&CK integration in Streamlit.

Custom Node Colors and Filters:

    Detail: Allow pentesters to set custom CVSS thresholds for red/yellow/green nodes or filter by service (e.g., show only HTTP nodes).
    Benefit: Tailors visualization to specific engagement needs.
    Implementation: Add sliders and dropdowns in app.py. Update config.yaml and visualizer.py for dynamic coloring.

3D Map Export to GNS3:

    Detail: Export the network topology as a GNS3 project file for simulation in GNS3.
    Benefit: Enables pentesters to test exploits in a virtualized environment.
    Implementation: Generate GNS3 .gns3 file in app.py using node/edge data from graph_manager.py.

Enhanced GNN Model:

    Detail: Improve attack path prediction by incorporating edge weights (e.g., port accessibility) and additional features (e.g., OS type).
    Benefit: Increases prediction accuracy for complex networks.
    Implementation: Update gnn_model.py with weighted GraphConv layers. Train on synthetic pentest data.
    Source Inspiration: Streamlit’s ML integration roadmap.

Open3D or PyVista Support:

    Detail: Integrate Open3D or PyVista for advanced 3D rendering (e.g., point clouds for network density).
    Benefit: Improves map interactivity and scalability for 10 nodes.
    Implementation: Add stpyvista or Open3D component in visualizer.py.

    Challenge: Ensure compatibility with Streamlit’s iframe rendering.

Automated Exploit Suggestions:

    Detail: Suggest Metasploit modules or exploit-db scripts for red nodes based on CVEs (e.g., exploit/windows/smb/cve_2020_0796_smbghost).
    Benefit: Accelerates exploitation during engagements.
    Implementation: Query exploit-db API in cve_fetcher.py. Display in UI via app.py.

Report Generation:

    Detail: Add a button to export the 3D map, JSON data, and GNN predictions as a PDF report.
    Benefit: Simplifies client reporting with professional visuals.
    Implementation: Use reportlab in app.py to generate PDF with Plotly screenshots and node details.

Dark Theme for UI:

    Detail: Implement a dark theme for the Streamlit UI to reduce eye strain during long pentests.
    Benefit: Improves usability in low-light environments.
    Implementation: Add theme option in app.py and CSS in .streamlit/config.toml.

Real-Time Alert Notifications:

    Detail: Notify pentesters of new red nodes or high GNN scores via email or in-app alerts.
    Benefit: Enhances situational awareness during dynamic scans.
    Implementation: Use smtplib in app.py for email or Streamlit’s st.balloons.

Multi-Scan Merge:

    Detail: Merge multiple Nmap XMLs (≤10 nodes total) into one map (e.g., combine scan1.xml, scan2.xml).
    Benefit: Supports iterative scanning in large engagements.
    Implementation: Extend parser.py to concatenate <host> elements. Update graph_manager.py.

Performance Optimization:

    Detail: Cache graph rendering and GNN predictions to reduce load times for repeated scans.
    Benefit: Speeds up analysis for 10-node scans.
    Implementation: Use st.cache_data in app.py and visualizer.py.

Geo-Location Mapping:

    Detail: Plot nodes on a 2D world map (e.g., using st.map) if public IPs are scanned, alongside the 3D map.
    Benefit: Contextualizes external attack surfaces.
    Implementation: Add st.map in app.py with IP-to-geo lookup via geoip2
